# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing!

## Development
- Requirements: Xcode + Swift toolchain.
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  swift test
  ```

## Making changes
- Prefer small, atomic changes with tests.
- Update `TICKETS.md` / `roadmap.md` when changing scope or priorities.
- Keep CLI output formats stable; if behavior must change, gate behind flags or a schema bump.

## Submitting
- Open a PR with a clear description and the tests you ran.
